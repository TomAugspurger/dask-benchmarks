# Dask Benchmarks

A suite of benchmarks for dask-related projects.

## Setup

Install [asv](http://asv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html)

Clone the repository.
TODO: Edit the asv configuration as necessary.

To run the benchmarks for a project, for example `dask`, change to that
directory and run `asv run`.
